<h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>One of my greatest passions in life is fitness. I powerlifted for a little (hit 475 on Squat at 165 BW) but have found a passion for bodybuilding I am a dedicated gym-goer who thrives on pushing my physical limits. Each workout is a journey to self-improvement, not just for my body, but for my mind and spirit as well. Beyond the gym, my heart belongs to my amazing girlfriend. We met in high school and I am forever grateful for all the memories we have shared. If you ever catch me outside the gym, you'll mostly find me at a thrift store. I have a knack for finding unique treasures and fashion gems that tell a story.</p>
